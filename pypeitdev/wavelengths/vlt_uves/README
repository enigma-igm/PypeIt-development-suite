The wavelength calibration required making some template solutions first from esorex data.
This was done using the esorex_to_pypeit script. Then, the wavelength calibration was performed using the
reidentify method and ech_fixed_format=True. Then, the wavelength calibration was generated for each setup
and the resulting WaveCalib Calibration frame was placed in the PypeIt_Templates directory.

The relevant information was collected in the uves_templ_pypeit.dat file, and these were all combined using
the ingest_archive script.

The following files generated here are now in the main Repo
with different names:

wvcalib_angle_fits.fits -> vlt_uves_angle_fits.fits
UVES_composite_arc.fits ->  vlt_uves_composite_arc.fits
